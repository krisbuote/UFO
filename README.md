# UFO - Urban Farming Organization
UFO is a sustainability focused Student Group @ University of Alberta whose mission is to invent and build sustainable agriculture technologies. See our [website here](http://uab.ca/urbanfarming).

The Arduino code is the latest version of our program that controls our rolling vertical farm. At a high level this program:
- turns the water pump on/off as a function of water level (protects pump from running dry)
- turns the LED lighting on/off as a function of time of day
- opens/closes exhaust vents as a function of humidity and temperature
- turns exhaust fans on/off when exhaust vents are opened
